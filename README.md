## Repository layout

- `Figure_code/`: R scripts and notes used to generate main figures, analyses, and setup steps.
- `Figure_PDFs/`: exported figure artifacts (PDFs or other outputs).
- `Supplementary_tables/`: supplementary table notes and helper scripts for supplementary figures.
- `data/`: placeholder for raw/processed datasets used by the scripts.

## Notes

Many figure scripts are stored without file extensions. Open them in an editor as R scripts when needed.
